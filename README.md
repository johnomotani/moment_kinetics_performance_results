This repository is used to store performance testing results for the `moment_kinetics` code https://github.com/mabarnes/moment_kinetics. The results are updated automatically by scripts in the `performance-tests/` subdirectory of `moment_kinetics`. This repository should not be updated manually except to update the list in `known_machines` or to add headers in the file for a new test.

Changelog
---------

v0.1.0 : At this tag are the last set of results from the original version of
         the `performance_tests/` scripts, which was used until commit
         8391427c861304bc97b0ebcd718ab71862412708 of `moment_kinetics` (before
         parallelization code was merged). After this the results were deleted
         and a new series was started.
