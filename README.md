This repository is used to store performance testing results for the `moment_kinetics` code https://github.com/mabarnes/moment_kinetics. The results are updated automatically by scripts in the `performance-tests/` subdirectory of `moment_kinetics`. This repository should not be updated manually except to update the list in `known_machines` or to add headers in the file for a new test.
